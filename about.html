        <p id="aboutme2"> My full name is Guillermo Jose Hernandez-Nieves and I am a Film Major here at <a href = "https://www.uri.edu/">URI</a> who is minoring in Web Programming.<br>
        I was born in Puerto Rico and moved here to Rhode Island back in 2016. It was a big move but I adapted fast and I've enjoyed living here ever since. <br>
        When it comes to my hobbies, I am interested in photography, reading, filmmaking, and manga.<br>
        <br>
        In the future, I aspire to be a jack of all trades within the film industry. Whether it be audio, video editing, lighting, or anything else, I hope to create products I can be proud of.
